A simulation of Koch snowflake, powered by Processing using Java as programming language.

The algorithm divides a straight line segment into 3 parts, being the middle part in two more. After this, rotates this parts in -(PI/3 RAD)  or (-60Â°), thus, forming an equilateral triangle, this functions grows in (4/3)^x, after the third stage, the figure looks like a snowflake.
 
To look like a snowflake, it's necessary start with 3 segments, forming a triangule.
